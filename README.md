# Godspeed Robotics

<em>
Godspeed/God spede/“may God speed you”.  Originated from Middle English, the phrase is to express good wishes for someone’s success or safety when they embark on a journey of challenging endeavor. <br>

Our interpretation for Godspeed is the speed of God as we break through the constraint of human limitation to reach godlike ability.
